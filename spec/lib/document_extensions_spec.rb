Diesel exhaust contains various gaseous and particulate pollutants, which, at high concentrations, pose adverse health effects. In this respect, various policy measures are being adopted worldwide to curtail emissions from diesel engines. This paper presents an assessment of diesel engine policy banning in the Greater Beirut Area. For this purpose, particulate matter levels in the air were measured after the ban and compared with concentrations reported prior to the ban. Health-based socio-economic benefits associated with improvement in air quality were then estimated using the long-term decrease of particulate matter as an indicator.\n"
